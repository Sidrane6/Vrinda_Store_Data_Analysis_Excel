 # Analysis & Dashboard
 The analysis is done by creating various charts with the  pivot table function in Excel.

The Dashboard gives insights on
- No. of orders received and the sales done by the store.
- The percentage of male and female customers.
- Different sales channels of the store and the percentage of orders received from them.
- Top states where the sales percentage is higher.
- Analysis of the age & gender of customers.
- And the status of the orders placed by the customers.
